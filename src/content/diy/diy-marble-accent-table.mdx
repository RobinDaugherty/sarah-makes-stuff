		Of course I'm going through a stage where I want, no, <em>need </em>
		everything marble. It's a craving deep in my soul that can't seem to be
		quenched. Okay, that sounds a little dramatic but you get the picture. I
		think a lot of you feel the same.

		from Crate and Barrel but $269?! Psh! My house is mainly Ikea so until they
		start making things with marble I'll be making it myself, which probably
		means I'll making it myself forever. Apparently marble isn't big in
		Sweden? ...Am I the only one that balks at furniture prices but will spend
		stupid amounts of money on shoes and purses? Yikes.

		Anywho, this table is sooooo incredibly easy and with a total price tag of
		$83.09, I'm all over it!

		Once you have your marble board, tripod stand, Liquid Nails and super sexy
		caulking gun, the first step in this two step project is to put a thin layer
		of the Liquid Nails on the stand.

		A few notes here, if you've never caulked there really is a seal and you
		really do have to puncture it. It's way at the bottom of the tip, unlike all
		the pictures I saw implied! I tried and tried to get that dumb caulk gun to
		work with no avail. I googled it and they said you have to puncture the seal
		but all the pictures showed doing it with a sewing pin so I got a pin and
		like... yeah... no seal. Turns out unless you have crazy<em> </em>long
		<em></em>pins, you're never going to puncture that thing. You'll need to
		find a very long nail or something, or if you're like me, have your husband
		show you that the caulking gun has a puncturing thing built in.
	</p>
	<p>
		Second note, use less than I show here. I had the Liquid Nails start to come
		out the side and through the little holes. If that happens, no biggie. You
		just have to smear it back up. I would recommend just keeping an eye on it.
