{<p>Who doesn't love a cocoa body scrub? They're my favorite, even if I always
leave the shower with a desperate need for something chocolate.{' '}

Cue the digging through baking bin for an open bag of chocolate chips.

{<p>This scrub was super easy to make and other than the hazelnut oil, you
probably have all the ingredients already in your kitchen! You could use a
different oil, like almond, but the hazelnut gives is nutella vibes. Yummm!</p>}
{<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</strong>
<br />1 cup brown sugar
<br />3 tbs cocoa power
<br />
1/3 cup hazelnut oil
<br />2 tsp vanilla extract
<br />
1/2 cup coconut oil</p>}

{<p>Add in coconut oil and continue to mix until fully incorporated. 
<em>
I recommend using an electric mixer. Just mix it on high for a few minutes
until you get a nice whipped texture.
