{<p>I've had a Instax camera for a couple years now but no way to display the
photos. I wanted something that would display several photos at a time but
didn't look too... college dorm-y if you know what I mean.</p>}
{<p>I was inspired by{' '}
<a target="_blank" href="https://sugarandcloth.com/diy-flip-photo-album/">
Sugar &amp; Cloth's DIY Flip Photo Album
</a>{' '}
but decided to make it a bit simpler by using a cutting board that could
then be hung on the wall or propped up somewhere.</p>}

{<p>First place your photos on your cutting board and to see how you would like
them to go. Then roughly place painter's tape under where you want your rows.</p>}
{<p>Take your ruler and pencil and measure out where you want your nails. Make
sure you measure the length and width and I always recommend measuring twice
to make sure you don't have any wonky nail holes. Then place your photos where
you marked the nail holes to make sure everything looks how you want it.</p>}

{<p>Now it's workout time! Hammer in your nails, making sure they are going in
straight.</p>}

{<p>Then you just have to remove your painter's tape and hole punch your photos so
you can place them on the board. Voila!</p>}

{<p>I decided to place mine on my new DIY bar cart for now. We're moving out of
this house in a few months so I'm trying to avoid making any more holes in the
walls. I can't wait to add more photos to it!</p>}
