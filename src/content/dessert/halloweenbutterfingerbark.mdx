{<p>Thank you to BUTTERFINGER® for sponsoring this post!</p>}

Where has the summer gone? I feel like it barely warmed up before it was
jacket weather again! In fact, there were an inordinate amount of days I had
to wear a jacket during the summer! I don’t know about where you are, but it
kept warming up but then cooling off again here in the Midwest. And along
with being forced into jackets, officially now daily, the onslaught of
pumpkin spice has already begun. I guess it’s time to give in to fall.</p>}
{<p>And that means it’s time to start planning your Halloween treats!</p>}
{<p>BUTTERFINGER® Fun Size candy bars are my favorite during Halloween! Who am
I kidding, they’re always my favorite candy bar, I just love that Halloween
gives me an excuse to eat them. And I’ve been super lucky in the past that
one of my step-sons, out of the kindness of his heart, always gave me all
the ones he was given trick-or-treating since he knew they were my favorite.
Unfortunately, he is now “too cool” for trick-or-treating so I have been
forced to fend for myself! So needless to say, I was so excited when
BUTTERFINGER® offered to sponsor a Halloween post with me. I had an excuse
to get my BUTTERFINGER® Fun Size candy bars <em>and</em> make something
super cute with them.</p>}
{<p></p>}
{<p>So for this year’s Halloween, I decided to make a Halloween Butterfinger
Monster Bark! I’ve been loving all the monster treats I’ve been seeing on
Pinterest so I decided to have a go at making a version. Speaking of
Pinterest, if you love Butterfinger as much as I do, you should check out

{<p>Oh, and not to get too overly sappy here, but to prove how deep my love of
BUTTERFINGER® is, growing up I would always go to the grocery store with my
Grandpa, and as you would expect out of a six-year-old, I did not enjoy it.
So, to make the trip more enjoyable (aka, make me less whiny) my Grandpa would
bring a couple BUTTERFINGER®s and buy a drink for us to share on the car ride
home. It could have been a commercial. Yes, imagine young, adorable Sarah, all
grumpy at the grocery store with her Grandpa. She’s bored out of her mind.
Then she starts to perk up as they’re walking to the car. As they get into the
car her Grandpa hands her a BUTTERFINGER® and she breaks into a huge
front-teeth-missing smile (yes, I didn’t have my front teeth as a kid). Then
they drive home smiling at each other all lovingly, munching on a
BUTTERFINGER®. Your heart is melting right now, isn’t it?</p>}
{<p>Okay, enough heartwarming, sappy stuff! Dry your tears and let’s get on to the
recipe!</p>}
{<p>This bark is super easy to make! With just some chocolate, various candy
melts, BUTTERFINGER® Fun Size candy bars, and a few other bits and bobs you
will have an adorable monster treat to share with your own little monsters. Or
not. You could eat it all yourself too. That’s what I would do. Oh, maybe make
two batches! One for yourself and one for your greedy monsters. You wouldn’t
want to chance them eating it all before you got some, right?</p>}
{<p>I went through each step in detail in the recipe below, but here’s the basic
gist with some pictures for you to reference!</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage2}
		alt="Halloween Butterfinger Bark | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>First, grab all your supplies! You’ll need a sheet pan lined with parchment
paper, white, orange, vibrant green, green, and black candy melts, some
eyeball candies, a red food writing pen, a pretzel rod, chocolate morsels, and
most importantly, some BUTTERFINGER® Fun Size candy bars.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage3}
		alt="Halloween Butterfinger Bark | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then to make the bases of your Butterfinger Monsters, dip your BUTTERFINGER®
Fun Size candy bars in the appropriate color candy melts and stick on their
eyes. For your Frankenstein, stick the broken off tips of your pretzel rod and
stick onto the side of his head. And for your Black Cat’s ears, dip two
chocolate morsels into your black melted candy melts and stick on the top of
its head. You can also go ahead and drizzle on the mummy’s wrappings.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage4}
		alt="Halloween Butterfinger Bark | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Once your Butterfinger Monster bases have fully dried, you can pipe on their
features. You can also dip a toothpick into the candy melts and use that to
draw on the features if you don’t have piping bags and tips.{' '}
<em>Details for adding the features are below in the main recipe.</em></p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage5}
		alt="Halloween Butterfinger Bark | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Once your adorable Butterfinger Monsters are done and dried, it’s time to make
the base of the bark! First, melt your chocolate morsels and white melting
chocolate. Pour your melted chocolate morsels onto a sheet pan lined with
parchment and quickly spread out into a rectangle. Then drizzle on the melted
white candy melts and swirl together with a toothpick. Then sprinkle on a
crushed BUTTERFINGER® Fun Size candy bar.</p>}

{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage7}
		alt="Halloween Butterfinger Bark | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then you just stick your Butterfinger Monsters into the bark and set aside to
let completely harden.</p>}
