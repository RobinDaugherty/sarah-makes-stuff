		Along with falling leaves, pumpkin spice, and sweaters, the cooler weather
		brings football!
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a confession, football is not my thing. Really no sport is. Growing
		up I just wasn’t around it much. Like at all. The only sporting event I have
		ever gone to, other than hockey games because hockey fights are very
		entertaining and require no knowledge of the actual sport, was a baseball
		game when I was seven. And yes, I cried when they lost even though other
		than going to that one game, I had never associated myself with that team.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, when the game is on I’m usually pretty clueless and join in with a, “Oh,
		great! They just did that thing! That thing was good, right? Oh, it wasn’t?
		Oh, no!”. Apparently, I can’t even take cues from the yelling to see whether
		something was good or not. And surprisingly that doesn’t impress many.
		Thankfully, I don’t have to make football conversation to win hearts and, if
		you’re as clueless as me, neither do you! 
	</p>
	<p>
		The way to everyone’s heart is through food. And for my family and friends,
		dessert to be specific. And as I’ve mentioned half a million times now, I
		love a theme. So to win the affection of your football loving crowd, I give
		you Touchdown Milkshakes made with Edy’s Touchdown Sundae ice cream.

		Yes, delicious Edy’s fudge-swirled vanilla ice cream with adorable caramel
		filled chocolate footballs made into creamy, fudgy, caramel-y, delicious
		milkshakes! Obviously you could just serve the ice cream for a quick
		crowd-pleasing and, most importantly, on-theme treat. But if you wanted to
		do something a little extra, these milkshakes are quick and easy and are
		sure to be hit.

		Now to make the milkshake, you just blend the already very delicious Edy’s
		Touchdown Sundae ice cream with milk and a little caramel. By the way, you
		better hustle to get this flavor, it’s only around for a limited time.

		Then you pour into glasses, top with whipped cream, and sprinkle on some
		team color sprinkles! Easy-peasy and sure to make everyone forget that
		nonsensical sports reference you tried to make! Note, always double-check to
		make sure you have the right team colors. I nearly made the mistake of going
		to a watch party with the wrong team’s colored dessert. That would{' '}
		<em>not</em> have<em></em>gone over well. These sports people seem to be
		pretty particular about that. I don’t even know if a delicious milkshake
		would help you there.
