{<p>Yes, I know <em>another</em> circus animal cookie recipe. Why you ask? Cause
when it comes to circus animal cookies, more is more. And also, why the heck
not! Come on, you can't tell me you can look at some circus animal cookies
and not smile. They're such a happy cookie!</p>}
{<p>This recipe is <em>so</em>
<strong> </strong>easy! It would be perfect to whip up for a birthday
breakfast or really any celebratory brunch! Or heck, just cause. Sometimes
you just need a little something-something pink with sprinkles.</p>}

{<p>So to make these guys, you just need a tube of crescent rolls (or two if you
have a crowd, or are feeling particularly peckish ), a bag of circus animal
cookies, and few staples you probably already have in your kitchen already.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage2}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>First things first, take some of your circus animal cookies and pulse in your
food processor (or blender) until you have circus animal cookie crumbs.{' '}
<em>Optional, greedily eat several pinches full. </em></p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage3}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then flour a work surface and unroll your dough. Side note, anyone else{' '}
<em>hate </em>opening these tubes? It's like the baking version of Pop Goes
the Weasel and I'm traumatized every time. Every. Single. Time.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage4}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then pinch your dough together. Flip it over and do it on the other side too.
Note, this is when you see whether or not you used enough flour haha.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage5}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Cut your dough in half and roll out a little with a floured rolling pin to
smooth everything out. Or if you're smarter than me, you could break it in
half in the beginning. You know, back when you had the perforations.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage6}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then brush on a little melted butter, or a lot of melted butter, just because
like circus animal cookies, more is more when it comes to butter.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage7}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Take your circus animal cookie crumbs and cover your dough.{' '}
<em>Optional, while greedily shoving several pinches full in your mouth.</em></p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage8}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Tightly roll up your dough.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage9}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Trim your sloppy ends, and cut into eight rounds. Eight delicious, magical
rounds.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage10}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Place your delicious, magical rounds into a greased mini muffin pan. Throw
into your oven that's been preheated to the temperature your crescent roll
dough says on the package. And bake for 8-10 minutes, or however long it says.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage11}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>While that's baking, make your icing by taking your powdered sugar and
whisking with vanilla and enough milk to get the right consistency. You want
it thick but not too thick to just be a glob.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage12}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then mix in circus animal cookie crumbs!</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage13}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>By now your rolls should be golden brown and ready to take out of the oven.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage14}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Right away, before it cools, drizzle about a teaspoon of your icing onto each
roll.</p>}
{<p><Picture
		src={ContentImage15}
		alt="Circus Animal Cookie Rolls | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Once cooled enough to touch, remove from pan and devour! These are best right
out of the oven but you can also place in an airtight container to snack on
for a few days.</p>}

{<p><strong>INGREDIENTS </strong>
<em>makes 32 mini rolls</em>
<br />2 8 ounce packages crescent roll dough
<br />
57 grams (4 tbs) butter, melted
<br />7 ounces (half a bag) Circus Animal Cookies
<br />
180 grams (1 ½ cups) powdered sugar
<br />4 grams (1 tsp) vanilla
<br />
2-4 tbs milk</p>}
{<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>}

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li>
		Preheat oven according to crescent roll dough package directions. Lightly
		grease mini muffin pan. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Unroll crescent roll dough. Take half the dough, a square of four
		triangles, and place on a floured surface. Pinch the perforations together
		on both sides. Using a floured rolling pin, smooth out dough. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Brush on 1 tablespoon, about a fourth, of the melted butter. Sprinkle on a
		thin, even layer of circus animal cookie crumbs. Tightly roll into a log,
		trim ends, and cut into eight rounds. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Place mini rolls into your prepared mini muffin pan. Repeat with the rest of
		the crescent roll dough. Bake according to package directions. You may have
		to do more than one batch depending on the size of your mini muffin pan.
	</li>
	<li>
		Meanwhile, whisk together powdered sugar with vanilla extract and milk,
		adding milk 1 tablespoon at a time, until consistency is reached. You want
		it thick, but not globby. Then whisk in ⅛ cup circus animal cookie crumbs.
		Add more milk if necessary to reach desired consistency. Drizzle over warm
		circus animal cookie rolls. 
	</li>
	<li>Eat right away, or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
