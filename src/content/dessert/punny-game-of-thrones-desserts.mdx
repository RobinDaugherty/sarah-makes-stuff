{<p>Obviously when I was asked to attend Game of Thrones Night at a friend's I
made it my mission to bring a themed dessert to every episode. After
searching I found that there was a real lack of Game of Thrones pun
desserts. What the heck?! Sure, there's some Sansa Lemon Cake recipes out
there, but where's the fun in that?! Here's what I ended up throwing
together. A few ended up being failures so there's only seven, but that's
seven more punny GoT desserts than used to exist in the world and that my
friend is a glorious thing.</p>}

were so incredibly easy. I was in a bit of a rush that day so being able to
quickly whip them together was a lifesaver. Looking back, I really wish I
had gotten tiny toothpick swords to stick through them though.</p>}

perfecting short crust was almost the death of me.</p>

. Yeah, this is where the themed background went out the window. I
completely forgot and then when I went to redo the photo I couldn't get it
to be as good. Meh, sometimes you gotta just roll with it.</p>

{<p>You probably figured this out by now, but I <em>might</em> love Game of
Thrones as much as I love puns ...and cheesecake. I'm already planning for
next season!</p>
