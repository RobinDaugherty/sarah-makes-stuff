		When one of my good friends was having a baby shower, of course I signed up
		for dessert duty. My first question was, what's the theme? Woodland was
		decided so I got to work searching Pinterest. Man, do I love a theme. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After spending what was probably five times the time amount of time
		necessary (you how that goes) , "moss" cupcakes, hedgehogs and chocolate
		acorns seemed like the perfect combo for woodland cupcakes!

		The mom-to-be is vegan so I had to make at least the cupcakes vegan. Instead
		of trying to make a vegan cupcake recipe myself, I played it safe and went

		.

	<p>
		For the frosting I made my favorite buttercream recipe but I switched out
		the butter and milk for vegan substitutes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		There were couple ways to go about making the "moss", I went with crumbled
		cake method. To keep things simple I made a soda cake. All you have to do it
		mix a box cake mix with 12 ounces of any carbonated beverage. It's like
		magic, seriously. I made two cakes since I was making ~50 cupcakes and they
		ended up being slightly different shades of green which I think ended up
		making it more mossy looking. If anyone asks, I totes did it on purpose ;)
	</p>
	<p>
		The chocolate acorns are super easy! I made about 200, since they were so
		simple and perfect for munching on.

		For the little hedgehogs I was going to use donut holes, as I had seen over
		on the Pinterest webs, but after three unsuccessful attempts to buy donut
		holes (of course I didn't go to a donut place, but still), I had an
		epiphany! Cream puffs! Ohhhhhh yeaaahhhhhh!  Look at those guys! They're
		adorable! And that they were frozen made the chocolate harden faster and
		everything. Cream puffs &gt; donut holes x 1000!

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>VEGAN "BUTTERCREAM" INGREDIENTS</strong>

			.
		</em>
		<br />1 cup vegan butter
		<br />
		3-4 cups powdered sugar
		<br />1 tablespoon vanilla extract
		<br />
		up to 4 tablespoons vanilla almond milk
		<br />
		green gel food coloring until desired color is reached

	<p>
		<strong>MOSS TOPPING INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		<em>I doubled this recipe to cover the 48 cupcakes.</em>
		<br />1 box Betty Crocker Super Moist White Cake Mix
		<br />
		12 ounces cream soda (or any carbonated beverage)
		<br />
		green gel food coloring until desired color is reached
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>CREAM PUFF HEDGEHOG INGREDIENTS</strong>

		36 mini cream puffs (I bought mine but if you wanted to get super
		adventurous, you could{' '}
		<a
			target="_blank"
			href="http://lovelylittlekitchen.com/classic-cream-puffs/"
		>
			make your own
		</a>
		.)
		<br />
		10 ounces chocolate, separated (I used chocolate almond bark)
		<br />
		chocolate sprinkles
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>ACORN CHOCOLATES INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		<em>Obviously you could cut this recipe down.</em>
		<br />4 ounces chocolate (I used chocolate almond bark)
		<br />
		200 Mini Nilla Wafers (11 ounce box)
		<br />
		200 Hershey Kisses (40 ounce bag)
		<br />
		200 chocolate chips
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>VEGAN "BUTTERCREAM" INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Beat butter for a few minutes with a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment
		on medium speed. Add 3 cups of powdered sugar and turn mixer on the lowest
		speed until the sugar has been incorporated with the butter. Increase mixer
		speed to medium and add vanilla extract, food coloring and 2 tablespoons of
		almond milk and beat for 3 minutes. If your frosting needs be stiffer, add

		<strong>MOSS TOPPING INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 13 x 9 inch cake pan. In a
		large bowl beat dry cake mix, food coloring and carbonated beverage with
		electric mixer on low speed 1 minute, and then on medium speed 2 minutes,
		scraping the side of the bowl. Pour into prepared cake pan. Bake 20 to 25
		minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool until
		room temperature and then crumble into small pieces.

		<strong>CREAM PUFF HEDGEHOG INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Set out some large plastic containers. Melt 8 ounces of the chocolate in a
		bowl as instructed on package. Pour sprinkles into a bowl. Moving quickly,
		and working in batches that will fit in your plastic containers, dip most of
		the cream puff into the chocolate, then sprinkles and place into the
		container. Once the container is full put in the freezer. Continue until all
		the hedgehogs have their "spikes". Now melt the remaining 2 ounces chocolate
		and place in a piping bag fitted with a #1 piping tip. Working in batches
		again, take out your cream puffs and pipe on two little eyes and a nose.
		Place back in the freezer. Take out of freezer 30 minutes before enjoying. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>ACORN CHOCOLATES INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Line your surface with parchment paper. Melt your 4 ounces chocolate in a
		bowl as instructed on package. Place in a piping bag fitted with a #2 piping
		tip. Place your Mini Nilla Wafers upside down on the parchment paper.
		Working in batches, pipe out a small amount of chocolate onto the center of
		the cookies and place a Hershey Kiss in the center. Once that is complete,
		wait until set, shouldn't be too long, and then flip over your chocolates so
		the Nilla Wafer is facing up. Then pipe a small amount of chocolate onto
		each chocolate chip and place in center of each cookie. Wait until set and
		then enjoy!
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>PUT IT ALL TOGETHER!</strong>
		<br />
		Once cupcakes have cooled, use a pairing knife and cut a hole out of the
		center of the cupcakes. Pipe frosting into the hole and then pipe a thin
		layer of frosting around the top of the cupcakes. Smooth out frosting with a
		small spatula. Take green cake crumbles and cover the frosting with it.
		You’ll have to play with it a little and smoosh it in. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Place acorns and hedgehogs as toppers on your cupcakes. If you went the
		vegan route with those cupcakes, leave some un-topped for your vegan
		friends.
