		Of course I had to make Lyanna Mormont dessert! As I've already professed,
		she's currently my fave. After a little researching, I discovered the Lady
		Baltimore cake. Aha! Pun perfection!

		The origins of the Lady Baltimore cake are disputed, but the first printings
		of it describe it as a white cake, with a meringue frosting and nut and
		fruit syrup frosting filling. I looked at a lot of recipes and saw that some
		people soaked the fruit and nuts in rum instead of mixing it into a syrup. I
		went that route as I'm sure it's how the bakers on Bear Island would make
		them. I also made a rum buttercream instead of the meringue frosting. You
		know, to go along with the rum filling. Not because buttercream is easier.
		No, never would I take the easy way out.

		I used a dark spiced rum and made cupcakes instead of a cake because I felt
		those were more true to the character too. She's a spicy wee thing!

		Now, if you don't like rum, you aren't going to like these cupcakes. They
		are a bit strong. But I'm assuming that's how she would like them. Small and
		innocent looking but with a surprise kick! Also, fair warning, none of the
		rum is cooked so they do have alcohol in them. Probably would avoid handing
		them out at a kids birthday party.

		They are not large cakes, but they are proud ones. And every cupcake from
		Bear Island has the strength of 10 mainland cupcakes. If they're half as
		ferocious as their namesake, you're all doomed.
