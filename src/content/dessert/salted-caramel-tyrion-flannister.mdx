		<strong>CHEESECAKE INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature <br />
		14 ounces sweetened condensed milk, divided
		<br />1 large whole egg, room temperature
		<br />5 large egg yolks, room temperature
		<br />1 teaspoon vanilla extract
		<br />
		100 grams (¾ cup) graham cracker crumbs
		<br />
		25 grams (2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>SALTED CARAMEL SAUCE INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />1 tablespoon corn syrup
		<br />2 tablespoon water
		<br />
		1/4 teaspoon salt
		<br />
		200 grams (1 cup) granulated sugar
		<br />
		173 grams (3/4 cup) heavy cream, warmed to at least 100°F
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>CHEESECAKE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the
		cream cheese on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until it is light and
		fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the stand mixer bowl to prevent
		lumps from forming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add half of the sweetened condensed milk to the bowl of the stand mixer and
		beat on low speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the
		stand mixer bowl and continue beating on low speed for 1 minute more, until
		the mixture is smooth and creamy and free of lumps. Repeat this step with
		the remaining sweetened condensed milk.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reduce the mixer speed to low. Slowly add first the whole egg and then the
		egg yolks to the bowl, one at a time. After adding each, scrape down the
		sides and bottom of the bowl. Continue beating on low speed for 1 to 2
		minutes, until the mixture is fully incorporated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add the vanilla to the bowl of the stand mixer and beat on low speed for 1
		minute, until the vanilla is just incorporated into the mixture. The mixture
		should be well blended, but not overbeaten. (Overbeating at this stage
		incorporates too much air and will cause the cheesecake to puff up while
		baking and then fall and crack while cooling.)
		<br />
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with
		granulated sugar and stir with a fork to combine. Grease the sides of a
		9-inch springform pan and sprinkle it with the cracker mixture, shaking any
		excess back into the bowl. Add the melted butter to the bowl and toss with a
		fork until the butter has moistened the crumb mixture. Scatter the crumbs
		evenly over the pan bottom and press into it using the bottom of a
		straight-sided glass. Bake for 10 minutes and let cool. Reduce oven to 280
		degrees F.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fill the springform pan with the cheesecake batter and place it on a baking
		sheet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven, directly on the middle
		shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the cake is slightly firm to the
		touch and jiggles in the center (this is a shallow cake, so it shouldn’t
		soufflé much). (If at the end of this baking time, the cake is starting to
		soufflé but still has a loose center, reduce the oven temperature to 250°F
		and bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, until the center is firm.) Remove from
		the oven and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
	</p>
	<p>Refrigerate for 1 hour to cool the cake completely.</p>
	<p>
		Loosen the cheesecake from the springform pan by sliding an offset spatula
		around the inside ring. Remove the springform pan from the cake and transfer
		to a plate. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight before decorating.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prepare the Salted Caramel (recipe below). Set aside while still warm, but
		not hot.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pour the Salted Caramel on the center of the cake. Using the back of a
		wooden spoon or a silicone offset spatula, spread the caramel evenly over
		the top of the cake, being careful not to spread over the cake’s edge.
	</p>
	<p>Transfer to the freezer for 2 to 3 hours before slicing.</p>
	<p>
		Slice the cake with a thin, nonserrated knife that is dipped in hot water
		and wiped dry after each slice. Serve immediately or store in the freezer
		well wrapped for up to 3 months.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>SALTED CARAMEL INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine the corn syrup, water,
		and salt. Stir with a spatula and cook for 1 minute, until the salt is
		dissolved and the corn syrup has melted.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sprinkle the sugar into the saucepan, taking care to cover the bottom of the
		saucepan as evenly as possible. Do NOT stir. Cook, using a pastry brush
		dipped in water to lightly wash down the sides of the pot, for 3 to 4
		minutes, until the mixture begins to caramelize. (Brushing the sides of the
		pan prevents the formation of sugar crystals.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the mixture becomes a light amber color, immediately remove from the
		heat and add the warmed heavy cream to the saucepan. Stir with a heatproof
		rubber spatula, scraping the sides and bottom of the pot and making sure to
		fully incorporate the cream into the caramel, until the mixture is fully
		combined. Note: Be careful at this stage, as the caramel is extremely hot
		and the cream will bubble up and release very hot steam.
	</p>
	<p>
		Transfer the caramel to a medium heatproof bowl. Set aside to cool to room
		temperature for 30 minutes; the caramel will thicken as it cools.
