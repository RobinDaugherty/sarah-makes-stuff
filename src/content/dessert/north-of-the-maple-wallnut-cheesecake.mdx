		<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		100 grams (¾ cup) graham cracker crumbs
		<br />
		200 + 75 grams (1 cup + 6 tablespoons) sugar, divided
		<br />
		83 grams (3 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted
		<br />
		1134 grams or 2 ½ pounds cream cheese
		<br />
		27 grams (3 tablespoons) flour
		<br />
		166 grams (½ cup) grade A medium amber maple syrup
		<br />4 eggs
		<br />2 egg yolks
		<br />
		58 grams (¼ cup) heavy cream
		<br />1 teaspoon cornstarch
		<br />
		113 grams or 4 ounces walnut halves
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, mix the graham-cracker crumbs with
		2 tablespoons of the sugar and stir with a fork to combine. Grease the sides
		of a 9-inch springform pan and sprinkle it with the cracker mixture, shaking
		any excess back into the bowl. Add the melted butter to the bowl and toss
		with a fork until the butter has moistened the crumb mixture. Scatter the
		crumbs evenly over the pan bottom and press into it using the bottom of a
		straight-sided glass. Bake for 10 minutes and let cool. Raise the heat in
		the oven to 500 degrees F.
	</p>
	<p>
		With an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until it is soft and fluffy,
		about 2 minutes. Mix the flour with the remaining sugar and add it and half
		the maple syrup to the cheese in thirds, mixing after each addition. Add the
		eggs and the yolks to the batter one by one, beating after each addition.
		Add the heavy cream and mix again. Pour the batter into the crust and bake
		for 15 minutes. Lower the oven to 200 degrees F and bake for an hour more.
		Turn off the oven, leave the door halfway open and let the cheesecake cool
		in the oven for a half-hour. Chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours and not
		more than 24.
	</p>
	<p>
		When ready to serve, heat the remaining maple syrup over low heat in a small
		saucepan until it bubbles and let simmer gently for 1 minute until it has
		thickened slightly. Whisk in the cornstarch and turn off the flame. Add the
		walnuts and turn to coat. Spread them out on a piece of parchment paper to
		cool and harden into praline, then sprinkle over the cheesecake.
