		These are a combination of pretty much all my favorite things. Cupcakes,
		sprinkles, buttercream, cookies, M&amp;M's AND piñatas! I mean, it really
		doesn't get any better than that.

		<strong>VANILLA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		220 grams (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />
		330-440 grams (3-4 cups) confectioners powdered sugar, sifted
		<br />¼ tsp table salt
		<br />1 tbs vanilla extract
		<br />
		up to 4 tbsp milk or heavy cream
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>FUNFETTI CUPCAKES INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		195 grams (1.5 cups) cake flour
		<br />1 1/2 tsp baking powder
		<br />
		1/4 tsp salt
		<br />
		110 grams (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />
		225 grams (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) granulated sugar
		<br />1 large egg
		<br />2 large egg whites
		<br />1 tsp vanilla extract
		<br />
		102 grams (1/4 cup + 3 tbsp)  whole milk
		<br />
		1/4 cup nonpareils rainbow sprinkles + some for topping cupcakes
		<br />
		Mini M&amp;M's
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>PINATA COOKIE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle
		attachment, cream together the sugars and the butter. Beat in the eggs. Add
		the oil. Sift the dry ingredients together, then gradually add them to the
		mixture. Mix in the vanilla extract.
	</p>
	<p>
		Split the dough into four even-size balls. Add gel food coloring to each
		dough ball until your desired color is achieved. (Gel food coloring gives
		you more intense colors than liquid food coloring does).
	</p>
	<p>
		Line a loaf pan (or similar size container) with plastic food wrap. Split
		all your colored dough balls in half, and layer the dough in the container.
		Alternate the colors so you end up with two layers of each color by the time
		you're done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cover the layered dough, and freeze it for four hours or overnight. This is
		the perfect time to make the buttercream and cupcakes!
	</p>
	<p>
		After they are done chilling, place them on a baking sheet lined with
		parchment paper, and bake at 350 degrees F for 12 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Immediately after you take them out of the oven, use your donkey piñata
		cookie cutter to cut the cookie shapes. This will create A LOT of cookies
		but I’m sure you’ll put them to good use ;)

		<strong>VANILLA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment,
		beat butter for a few minutes. Add 3 cups of powdered sugar and turn your
		mixer on the lowest speed (so the sugar doesn't blow everywhere) until the
		sugar has been incorporated with the butter. Increase mixer speed to medium
		and add vanilla extract, salt, and 2 tablespoons of milk/cream and beat for
		3 minutes. If your frosting needs a more stiff consistency, add remaining
		sugar. If your frosting needs to be thinned out, add remaining milk 1
		tablespoon at a time.

		<strong>FUNFETTI CUPCAKE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift cake flour, baking powder and salt
		together, set aside.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment,
		cream butter and granulated sugar until pale and fluffy. Mix in egg, then
		mix in egg whites one at a time, blending until combined after each
		addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Working in three separate batches,
		beginning and ending with milk, add 1/3 of the milk, alternating with 1/2 of
		the flour mixture and mixing just until combined after each addition. Using
		a rubber spatula, gently fold in sprinkles.
	</p>
	<p>
		Divide mixture among 12 paper lined muffin cups, filling each about 3/4
		full. Bake in preheated oven 17 - 19 minutes until toothpick inserted into
		center of cupcake comes out clean. Allow to cool in muffin tin several
		minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cool completely then “core”
		your cupcakes and fill with mini M&amp;M’s, I used a large piping tip. Then
		pipe buttercream frosting and store in an airtight container. When ready to
		serve, top with sprinkles and a piñata cookie.
