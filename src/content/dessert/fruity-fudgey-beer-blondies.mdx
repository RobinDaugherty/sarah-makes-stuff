		It's July and I don't know about where you live, but here it has officially
		decided to be hot. It was off and on there for a bit, kind of more spring
		than summer, but I think the hot is finally here to stay.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the hot weather, comes summer parties and thus, summer beers! Summer
		beers are my favorite. Basically, unless I'm having tacos, where Modelo is
		the only appropriate beer in my opinion, you'll see me with a tangerine,
		pineapple or watermelon beer. You can probably tell I'm not a hard core
		serious beer drinker. I'm also that chick that goes with the pink cocktail
		if there is one. I have no shame.
	</p>
	<p>
		So I've been wanting to make a beer brownie, but was inspired to go the
		blondie route instead to use one of my favorite beers. Something light and
		fruity that's perfect for summer get togethers!

		For this recipe, I went with{' '}

			Rhinegiest Peach Dodo

		, a peach beer from one of my favorite local breweries. If you're ever in

		rooftop bar, and if you are a more serious beer drinker, some great hoppy

		But you can use whatever fruit beer you have on hand or can easily get! You
		just need to have corresponding syrup to go with it. Perhaps pineapple, pear
		or strawberry? Those are just a few that would be perfect for this.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh, I also made this recipe with actual white chocolate, so it's good and
		fudgey. None of that no-actual-chocolate-blondie nonsense that's really a
		glorified cookie bar.

		So to get started, preheat your oven to 350°F and line a 9x9 pan with
		parchment. Then take a 1/2 cup of your fruit beer and bring it to a boil.
		Keeping an eye on it, let it simmer until it's reduced by half, about 3-8
		minutes. You want to make sure you have a 1/4 cup. Oh, one of the best
		things about this recipe is you get to drink the rest of that beer. Any
		excuse for day drinking is a-okay in my book. I mean, you can't let it go to
		waste, right? And nobody wants that beer flat later!
