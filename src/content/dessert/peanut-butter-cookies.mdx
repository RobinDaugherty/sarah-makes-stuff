{<p>Near our house we have a coffee shop that sells the best peanut butter
cookies I've ever had. I got to thinking about those cookies and then of
course I had to have one. I was looking pretty rough that day and didn't
want to go through the hassle of making myself presentable enough to leave
the house so I did what any wife would do, I <em>subtly</em> dropped hints
about wanting a cookie to my husband. He did not take the hint, but instead
went off to run other errands. At that point I gave in and decided to try to
make an even better peanut butter cookie. It was a tall order but what else
was I going to do?! You know, other than putting on a pair of pants,
slapping on some mascara and driving 5 minutes to the coffee shop?</p>}

{<p>I decided to go ahead and throw together an old reliable peanut butter cookie
recipe I've had for a long time, but decided to add in some peanut butter
chips to make them extra magical.</p>}

{<p>In my opinion you can't go wrong with peanut butter chips. Throw as many as
you can in there as long as the batter still sticks together! I went with a
cup but really I think a little more wouldn't be a bad thing. More is more
when it comes to those little guys!</p>}

{<p>This recipe is a pretty basic cookie recipe but I find most of the time that
basic is good! And man were these good! Maybe even better than the ones from
the coffee shop.</p>}
{<p>Side note, my husband did come back from errand shopping with peanut butter
cookies. He's such a good boy! These were already made but hey, you won't hear
me complaining about too many cookies in the house.</p>}
