		Doesn't Citron au Tartgaryen roll off the tongue nicely? I also made a
		coconut tart but Coconut Tartgaryen just didn't sound as cool so it lost
		out. Poor thing. It was mighty tasty going down though.

		<strong>TART SHELL INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		195 grams (1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
		<br />
		1/8 teaspoon salt
		<br />
		113 grams (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />
		50 grams (1/4 cup) granulated white sugar
		<br />1 large egg, lightly beaten
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>LEMON CURD INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />2 large eggs, plus 2 egg yolks
		<br />
		150 grams (3/4 cups) granulated sugar
		<br />1 tablespoon lemon zest
		<br />
		120 ml (½ cup) freshly squeezed lemon juice (2-3 lemons for both zest and
		juice)
		<br />2 tablespoons heavy cream, optional
		<br />
		113 grams (½ cup) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>TART SHELL INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In a separate bowl, whisk the flour with the salt. Place the butter in the
		bowl of your electric mixer, or with a hand mixer, and beat until
		softened. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Gradually add the
		beaten egg, beating just until incorporated. Add the flour mixture all at
		once and mix just until it forms a ball. Flatten the pastry into a disk,
		cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 15-30 minutes or just until
		firm (can place in freezer for about 10-15 minutes.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Lightly butter and flour, or spray with a non-stick vegetable/flour cooking
		spray, an 8 - 9 inch (20 - 23 cm) tart pan with a removable bottom. Once the
		pastry has chilled sufficiently, evenly pat onto the bottom and up the sides
		of the tart pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about
		15 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F and place rack in center of oven.
		Lightly prick bottom of pastry crust with the tines of a fork (this will
		prevent the dough from puffing up as it bakes). Place tart pan on a larger
		baking pan and bake crust for 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350
		degrees F and continue to bake the crust for about 15 minutes or until crust
		is dry and lightly golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack
		to cool. If desired, seal the crust with an egg white glaze or apricot
		glaze. Can be covered and stored for a few days.

		<strong>LEMON CURD INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In a medium heatproof bowl, place eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and
		heavy cream and whisk to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of
		simmering water (bain-marie). Cook on moderate heat, whisking constantly,
		until mixture becomes thick (mine was ready in 10 minutes, but it can take
		up to 20). If you have a thermometer, it should register 170F; otherwise, it
		should coat the back of a wooden spoon and leave a clear pass if you run
		your finger through it. The curd will thicken more once cooled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remove from heat and immediately strain mixture through a sieve. Add butter,
		a few cubes at a time, and whisk until completely melted and incorporated,
		and mixture is smooth. Take your time with it—the whisking makes for an airy
		and light texture. Allow to cool to room temperature before filling the
		tart.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Lemon curd can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a
		week, or can be frozen for up to 2 months. To thaw, place overnight in the
		fridge. Whisk the mixture to smoothen it before using.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Fill the tart shell with lemon curd, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours
		until chilled.
