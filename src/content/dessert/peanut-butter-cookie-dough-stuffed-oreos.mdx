{<p>Oreos are probably in my top ten favorite cookies, no, desserts, no,{' '}
<em>foods</em> of all time. So when I saw Peanut Butter Oreos, I knew I had
to have them. And I had to make them better. Chocolate covering them always
does the trick but what else… stuffing them peanut butter cookie dough! Que
the big, scary excited grin!</p>}
{<p>This is a super easy way to make quite a decadent treat. Side note, how do
you feel about the word “decadent”? Some people hate it. I’m okay with it
personally. Just don’t say anything is “moist”. Gross.</p>}

{<p>So you start out by making your peanut butter cookie dough. My recipe is
really just thick peanut butter buttercream that I added in some cut up
Reese’s Minis into to add a little texture. It is soooo good.</p>}

{<p>Then you take apart your Oreos. Not a single one of mine came apart cleanly so
I used my handy little spatula to take off the bit that didn’t stay on the
cream side and smooth it back on.</p>}

{<p>Then you just roll out teaspoon size cookie dough balls and smoosh them onto
your cookie.</p>}

{<p>Dip ‘em in some melted chocolate and voila! Oh, you can also add a little
peanut butter drizzle to make it a little snazzier too. Give it the old
razzle-dazzle!</p>}

{<p>Oh man, looks like one of those earth cut aways where you see all the layers.
Tasty, tasty layers.</p>}

{<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
<br />
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
<br />
1/4 cup peanut butter
<br />
1.5 cups powdered sugar
<br />1 tsp vanilla
<br />
1-3 tbs milk
<br />
1/2 cup Reese's Minis, chopped
<br />
Peanut Butter Oreos
<br />
16 ounces chocolate
<br />
1/4 cup peanut butter chips, optional
<br />1 tsp coconut oil</p>}
{<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
<br />
In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together butter and
peanut butter. Once incorporated add in powdered sugar. It will be thick. Add
in vanilla and 1 tablespoon milk. Mix, if still too thick, add in more milk,
little by little. If you make it too thin, you can always add more powdered
sugar. You want it to be cookie dough consistency, obviously. Stir in chopped
Reese's Minis.</p>}
{<p>Separate Oreos so that cream is on one side. Roll out cookie dough into
teaspoon size balls and place on the non-cream Oreo half. Smoosh down and
place together with cream half.</p>}
{<p>Melt chocolate per instructions, dip stuffed Oreos into chocolate and place on
parchment or wax paper. Once hardened, heat peanut butter chips in a microwave
safe bowl. I found that they didn't seem to melt, so once heated, add in
coconut oil and mix until liquid. Place in a piping bag fitted with a #2 tip
and drizzle over the chocolate covered Oreos.</p>}
