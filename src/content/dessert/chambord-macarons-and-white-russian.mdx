{<p>We recently moved and I'm officially settled in! Woohoo! I got <em>very</em>{' '}
stressed about the move and took a little break from blogging, but now I'm
feeling inspired again. Btw, anyone else recently buy a house? It's about
the most stressful experience ever. Glad it's over.</p>}
{<p>Anyway, with a new house comes new appliances. Well, some newer than others.
We replaced the fridge, dishwasher and washer and dryer, but not the oven.
It's electric and my husband is set on switching it out with gas and getting
a fancy range hood. He's still working out all the details for that but in
the mean time I decided to test out the one we have with a batch of
macarons.</p>}
{<p>I have a confession, I completely failed at making <em>a lot</em> of batches
of macarons at the old house. No matter what I did they tended to flop. I
tried so many recipes.  My oven thermometer told me the oven was 50 degrees
cooler but upping the temperature 50 degrees to compensate didn't seem to
make a difference so then I thought maybe the thermometer was
broken. Nothing worked. I thought I was a macaron failure.</p>}

{<p>So in an effort to reinspire myself and get my baking confidence back up, I
broke in our "new" oven with a batch. Low and behold! I got my best macarons
yet! I'm not a macaron failure after all! So if you're having issues no matter
what you do, maybe have someone out to take a look at your oven. It may not be
you.</p>}

{<p>Now onto the macarons, these babies have a Chambord ganache filling. If you
don't know what Chambord is, you've been missing out. It's raspberry liquor
that is absolutely delicious. I just made my normal ganache and added 30 grams
of the good stuff to give it a little raspberry boozy flavor.</p>}

{<p>While on my Chambord kick, I figured I might play around with adding it to my
husband's favorite cocktail, the White Russian. I realize my only other
cocktail recipe was a White Russian... I promise to move on to something else
next time, maybe I'll doctor my favorite, the Amaretto Sour.</p>}

227 grams dark chocolate

{<p><strong>MACARON SHELL INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
<br />
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Trace 5cm circles onto parchment paper and
place onto a cookie sheet, making sure the side with the pen/pencil markings
is on the bottom so it doesn't touch the batter. Or use a{' '}

{<p>Sift together almond flour powdered sugar to make your tant pour tant. Add 55
grams of egg whites to your tant pour tant and mix together with a stiff
spatula until you get a paste.</p>}
{<p>In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the other half the egg whites until
they form soft peaks. Once that is achieved, turn the mixer down to low and
let that run while you make your syrup.</p>}
{<p>In small, heavy bottomed pot, heat your sugar and water on med-high until it
reaches 244 degrees F. Make sure you do not stir the mixture while it is
heating.</p>}
{<p>Once it reaches the desired temperature, turn the mixer on high and slowly
pour the syrup in.  Let this run for about 5 minutes, or unil the bowl feels
cool and the egg whites are glossy and smooth.</p>}
{<p>Add the gel food coloring and one-third of the meringue to the paste and mix
just until combined. Make sure when you add in your gel food coloring you make
it a few shades darker. It's going to lighten after you mix in the rest of the
meringue and bake the macarons. Do not use liquid food coloring, it will thin
out your batter.</p>}
{<p>Then mix half of the meringue that's left over until just combined. When
mixing the last bit of meringue, continuing mixing until the consistency is
like molten lava. It should drop off the spatula.</p>}
{<p>Put your batter into a pastry bag fitted with a large piping tip. Pipe your
batter out onto your prepared sheet into the center of each circle. Each one
should be 10 grams. I put my cookie sheet on my scale to make it easy. Once
your cookies are all piped out, drop the pan onto the counter a few times to
get some bubbles out and flatten them out a little. I also tend to take a
toothpick and smooth out any tips.</p>}
{<p>Set out until they go matte and when you touch them they dent instead of
sticking to your finger, about 15-30 minutes. While waiting, make the Chambord
Ganache (see recipe below).</p>}
{<p>Once your shells are ready, bake for 9-12 minutes. You'll know they're done
when they're able to pop off the mat/parchment.</p>}
{<p>Match up your cookies with ones that are the same shape and size and pipe a
little bit of Chambord Ganache onto one side. Gently twist and press together.</p>}
{<p>Place in fridge for at least 8 hours. Bring to room temperature before
enjoying.</p>}
{<p><strong>CHAMBORD GANACHE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
<br />
Chop the dark chocolate finely and place in a bowl. Heat the heavy cream until
boiling and pour over the chocolate. Don't stir! Cover with plastic wrap, or
put a lid on the bowl, and let sit for 2 minutes.</p>}
{<p>Add in Chambord and stir until combined. Note, if not all the pieces of melted
chocolate are melted after you've stirred it, then place the bowl over a pot
of boiling water and stir until smooth.</p>}
{<p>Place in fridge to set. You want to make sure it's really firm so it doesn't
squish out the side of your macarons.</p>}
