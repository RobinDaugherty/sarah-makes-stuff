		Can you believe it's already March? We've already had some pretty warm days
		here in Cincinnati, but it's almost Spring! Crazy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And with March comes St. Patricks Day! I'm not big on heavy drinking, I'm a
		complete lightweight, but I am big on Lucky Charms. And though I'm a
		heavyweight champion when it comes to sweets, I think the sweets won this
		round. I totally made myself sick eating the marshmallows when I was making
		these cookie bars. Rookie mistake.

		These cookie bars are great though! Not only are they easy to make, they are
		also faster than making cookies. Cutting out the scooping time and the
		multiple batches having to go in the oven. Perfect for a St. Patty's Day
		party!
	</p>
	<p>
		I have to say I failed at my first attempt at these. I spent all the time
		sorting the cereal from the marshmallows to make a marshmallow layer on the
		bottom, only to have the marshmallow layer separate from the cookie layer. I
		did it in a glass pan of course, with no parchment. What was I thinking?! I
		really don't know how I thought that would work out but it did make for some
		cool tie-dye cave action and it did taste pretty good. I ate most of it.
		Like I said, the sweets won that day. They won by a landslide. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to not risk another failed batch so I skipped the marshmallow
		layer on the bottom and stuck to them just being on the top.

		To make these bars, I whipped up a batch of soft sugar cookie dough,
		coloring it green of course. You don't want the bars getting pinched on
		their big day! Also, you can say you're wearing green on the inside if you
		need to! 
	</p>
	<p>
		I smoothed it out onto a jelly pan lined in parchment. It will keep whatever
		shape, so you want to make sure you get it smooth as possible. I recommend
		after using an offset spatula to smooth it out, to take a separate piece of
		parchment out and place it on top of the dough and smooth it further with
		your hands. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Then you just pop it in the oven, after taking the top parchment off of
		course. While it's baking you can whip up your frosting and sort your Lucky
		Charms cereal pieces from the marshmallow pieces, eating all the misshapen
		or broken ones obviously. ...I really need to work on my willpower.

	<p>
		Once your bars are out of the oven and they've completely cooled, you just
		top with the frosting and completely cover with the Lucky Charms
		marshmallows. Then just trim the sides and cut into squares. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And there you have it! Cookie bars that are so delicious, they must be
		magic! Get it, get it? ;)

		<strong>COOKIE BARS INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />2 cups granulated sugar
		<br />4 eggs, room temperature
		<br />3 tablespoons sour cream, room temperature
		<br />1 tsp vanilla extract
		<br />
		green gel food coloring
		<br />5 1/2 cups cake flour
		<br />1 tsp baking powder
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>FROSTING INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />3 cups powdered sugar
		<br />1 tsp vanilla extract
		<br />
		1-3 tbs milk
		<br />2 cups Lucky Charms marshmallows
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9 x 13 inch jelly pan with parchment
		paper.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat
		butter and sugar until light and fluffy. In a small bowl, beat eggs, sour
		cream, vanilla extract and green gel food coloring until combined. You can
		add more food coloring later so I recommend starting light. Add egg mixture
		to butter mixture and beat until combined. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In a large bowl, whisk together cake flour and baking powder. Add to wet
		ingredients and mix until combined. Don't over-mix or they will be tough.
	</p>
	<p>
		Spread dough into lined jelly pan. Using an offset spatula smooth out the
		dough. Place a second piece of parchment over the dough and continue to
		smooth out with your hands until as flat and smooth as possible. Remove top
		parchment and place in preheated oven. Bake for 12-18 minutes or until
		toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. You don't want to
		overbake or they will be dry. Place on a cooling rack and let cool
		completely. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Frost bars <em>(frosting recipe below) </em>and top with Lucky Charms
		marshmallows. Trim edges and cut into squares.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>FROSTING INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add in vanilla
		extract. Add in milk until desired consistency is reached. You want it to be
		spreadable, but hold it's shape.
	</p>
