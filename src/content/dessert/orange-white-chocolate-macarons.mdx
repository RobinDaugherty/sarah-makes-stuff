		These macarons are filled with an orange white chocolate ganache that is
		perfect for summer! 
	</p>
	<p>
		The first thing you want to do is get all your equipment together. You're
		going to need a scale, a sifter, a small heavy bottomed pot, an electric
		mixer with a whisk attachment, a candy thermometer, a stiff spatula, two
		piping bags, a large piping tip, and a cookie sheet with either a silpat mat
		or parchment. You can trace 5cm circles onto parchment paper if you don't
		have a handy mat that already has the circles on it. Just make sure you flip
		it over so the pen/pencil markings aren't touching the batter. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After that you want to get all your ingredients together. I find it best to
		go ahead and prep everything before starting. I accidentally added all of
		the egg whites, instead of half of them, to my tant pour tant once because I
		didn't set everything out beforehand. You don't want to do that. Almond
		flour is expensive.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
	<p>
		Now we're ready to get started! Sift 150 grams of almond flour with 150
		grams of powdered sugar to make your tant pour tant. You might want to go
		ahead and sift more than that together so you have it on hand.

		Add 55 grams of room temperature egg whites to the tant pour tant and mix
		together with a stiff spatula until you get a paste. If it is REALLY hard to
		mix then chances are you got your measurements off and your batter is going
		to be too thick. So if your arm is screaming in pain during this process you
		might want to just start over. And that is when you'll thank yourself for
		making that extra tant pour tant.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
	<p>Your paste should look something like this.</p>
	<p>
		Now it's meringue time. We're doing the Italian method so the first thing
		you need to do is whisk the other half the room temperature eggs whites in a
		stand mixer until they form soft peaks. Once that is achieved, turn the
		mixer down to low and let it run while you make your syrup.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make your syrup you need to heat up your sugar and water to 118 degrees
		C/244 degrees F. DO NOT STIR! Just sit tight and stare at the thermometer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once it reaches the desired temperature, turn the mixer on high and slowly
		pour the syrup in.  Let this run for about 5 minutes, or until the bowl
		feels cool and the egg whites are glossy and smooth. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Your syrup will most likely splash around a bit and create little spikes on
		the whisk attachment and harden around the edge of your meringue. Be careful
		that you don't get any hard pieces when adding the meringue to your paste.

		Pipe your batter out into the little circles on your silpat mat or parchment

	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've piped the batter out, drop the pan onto the counter a few times
		to get some of the air bubbles out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now let them set out until they go matte and when you touch them they dent
		instead of sticking to your finger.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once your cookies are ready, put them in a 325 degree F oven for 9-12

		<strong>MACARON SHELL INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		150 grams almond flour
		<br />
		150 grams powdered sugar
		<br />
		110 grams egg whites, divided
		<br />
		55 grams water
		<br />
		165 grams granulated sugar 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>ORANGE WHITE CHOCOLATE GANACHE INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		227 grams white chocolate, good quality, not chips
		<br />
		115 grams heavy cream
		<br />1 tsp orange extract
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>MACARON SHELL INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat over to 325 degrees F. Trace 5cm circles onto parchment paper and
		place onto a cookie sheet, making sure the side with the pen/pencil markings
		is on the bottom so it doesn't touch the batter. Or use a silpat mat that is
		already marked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sift together almond flour powdered sugar to make your tant pour tant. Add
		55 grams of egg whites to your tant pour tant and mix together with a stiff
		spatula until you get a paste.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the other half the egg whites until
		they form soft peaks. Once that is achieved, turn the mixer down to low and
		let that run while you make your syrup.
	</p>
	<p>
		In small, heavy bottomed pot, heat your sugar and water on med-high until it
		reaches 118 degrees C/244 degrees F. Make sure you do not stir the mixture
		while it is heating. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once it reaches the desired temperature, turn the mixer on high and slowly
		pour the syrup in.  Let this run for about 5 minutes, or unil the bowl feels
		cool and the egg whites are glossy and smooth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Add the food coloring and one-third of the meringue to the paste and mix
		just until combined. Make sure when you add in your gel or powdered food
		coloring you make it a few shades darker. It's going to lighten after you
		mix in the rest of the meringue and bake the macarons. Do not use liquid
		food coloring, it will thin out your batter.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Then mix half of the meringue that's left over until just combined. When
		mixing the last bit of meringue, continuing mixing until the consistency is
		like molten lava. It should drop off the spatula. If you do not reach that
		and the batter just sticks to the spatula, it means your batter is too
		thick.
	</p>
	<p>
		Put your batter into a pastry bag fitted with a large piping tip. I used an
		808 tip. Pipe your batter out onto your prepared tray into the center of
		each circle. Each one should be 10 grams. I put my cookie sheet on my scale
		to make it easy. Once your cookies are all piped out, drop the pan onto the
		counter a few times to get some bubbles out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Set out until they go matte and when you touch them they dent instead of
		sticking to your finger. While waiting, make Orange White Chocolate Ganache
		(see recipe below).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once your cookies are ready, bake for 9-12 minutes. You'll know they're done
		when they're able to pop off the mat/parchment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Match up your cookies with ones that are the same shape and size and pipe a
		little bit of Orange White Chocolate Ganache onto one side. Gently twist and
		press together.
	</p>
	<p>
		Place in fridge for at least 8 hours. Bring to room temperature before
		enjoying.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>ORANGE WHITE CHOCOLATE GANACHE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Chop the white chocolate finely and place in a bowl. Heat the heavy cream
		until boiling and pour over the chocolate. Don't stir! Cover with plastic
		wrap, or put a lid on the bowl, and let sit for 2 minutes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Add in orange extract and stir until combined. Note, if not all the pieces
		of melted chocolate are melted after you've stirred it, then place the bowl
		over a pot of boiling water and stir until smooth.
	</p>
	<p>Place in fridge to set. </p>
