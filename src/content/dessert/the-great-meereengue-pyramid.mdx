{<p>Game of Thrones season 7 continues! Time for another GoT dessert 💃🏻. This
week I decided to make a coffee meringue pyramid in the spirit of the Great
Meereen Pyramid.</p>}

	/></p>}
{<p>First I made a batch of coffee meringues. I've never made meringues before but
I actually didn't find them to be too bothersome. These are delicious all on
their own by the way!</p>}
{<p><Picture

		alt="The Great Meereengue Pyramid | Sarah Makes Stuff"
	/></p>}
{<p>Then I made some coffee flavored pastry cream (also delicious on its own and
honestly could be eaten with a spoon).  I made a 4x4 square and then built it
up from there, using the pastry cream to stick it all together.</p>}

	/></p>}
{<p>After my great pyramid was made, I drizzled a mocha glaze over the whole thing
and sprinkled with chopped pecans.</p>}

{<p>Look at that beauty! Coffee pecan heaven!</p>}

{<p>The pastry cream will soften your meringues so this does have to devoured in a
timely fashion. You can make the meringues up to a week ahead of time, and the
pastry cream up to a day before and assemble right before serving.</p>}

{<p>If a great pyramid isn't quite your style, you can make mini pyramids by
piping a little pastry cream on the top of each meringue and drizzling a
little coffee glaze and pecans on the top.</p>}

<ol>
	<li>
		Preheat oven to 250℉ with a shelf in the lower third of oven and baking
		stone (or pizza stone), if you have it, placed on the shelf. Line a large
		cookie sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. 
	</li>
	<li>
		In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg
		whites with cream of tartar on low speed for about 30 seconds. Bring speed
		up to medium-high until{' '}

			soft peaks
		</a>{' '}
		form. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a bit of the caster sugar and the instant espresso powder and continue
		to beat on medium-high. Continue to add in a little caster sugar at a time
		until all but 2 tablespoons is incorporated. Beat until whites are smooth
		and shiny and very stiff peaks form when beater is lifted. 
	</li>
	<li>
		In a separate bowl, whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons caster sugar, the
		powdered sugar, and flour. Sprinkle part of the sugar mixture on top of the
		meringue and fold in with a large spatula. Continue sprinkling and folding
		until all of the sugar mixture is incorporated. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Pipe 1.5-inch to 2-inch rounds onto prepared baking sheet. They don't expand
		so try to fit them all on one sheet. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Turn oven down to 200℉ and place baking sheet on baking stone and bake 1
		hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, until completely dry. Remove from oven and
		let cool completely.
