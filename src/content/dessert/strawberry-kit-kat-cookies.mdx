		On Wednesday we eat pink treats continues this week with Strawberry Kit Kat
		Cookies! I'm thinking this should be a weekly thing. I mean, what couldn't
		be made better by making it pink? Eh, nothing, that's what. And let's be
		honest, Hump Day needs a little pink pick me up.

		I think myself, like a lot of girls growing up, loved pink and then did a
		complete 180 around 6 or 7 and <em>hated</em> it. I actually remember it
		clearly. I only wore dresses or skirts and loved everything and anything
		pink until I left my small preschool and went into nig, scary 1st grade.
		Dresses and pink were gone in flash. They were <em>not </em>cool and of
		course, I couldn't possibly do anything different. I buried my love of pink
		and floral dresses deep inside me and had my mom buy me baby blue striped
		Adidas, demin shorts, and overalls. It was the mid-nineties, we all wore
		overalls. All the while stealing quick glances at the pink striped Adidas,
		the flowy skirts, and the dresses with bows and rosettes.

	<p>
		I think it was around 16 I had enough confidence to go back to declaring
		pink as my favorite color, and it hasn't changed once since.

		Just look at #millennialpink on Instagram! Even if pink isn't your go-to
		color, you can't help but lust over those photos. Pink vintage Fiats, pink
		sneakers, pink houses, pink fancypants restaurants! Ugh, I die. I want it
		all. I want to see it all. I want to take all my photos in front of those
		wonderful pink walls! I'm battling with my husband currently on our front
		door being painted pink. If it were pink, our house would probably be
		Instagram famous! #thedream
