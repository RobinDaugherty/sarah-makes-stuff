{<p>I recently discovered Ferrero Raffaellos. For some reason they never
appealed to me when I've seen them, but I happened to finally try one on the
recommendation of someone else, and, like, what the heck?! How have been
missing out on these my whole life?! Now, if you don't like coconut, you
won't like these, but if you do like coconut get ready to have your mind
blown. So good! <em>So good!</em></p>}
{<p>Okay, so obviously after my Raffaello awakening I knew I had to incorporate
them into something. Easter is surprisingly close so I thought little bunny
cakes with little Raffaello tails would be just the thing.</p>}

{<p>These were so easy to make! I whipped up a batch of carrot cake bars. This
carrot cake bar has  the consistency of cake, fluffy and delicious. To make
these even easier, you could use a carrot cake mix. I topped it with a
cinnamon cream cheese frosting, cut them out into little bunnies and added
little Raffaellos onto their little bunny butts.</p>}

halfway through baking.</p>}

a cooling rack. Meanwhile, make frosting (recipe below).</p>}

bars. Make sure the frosting is evenly distributed and as smooth as you can
get it. You want to take your cookie cutter and make sure your bars with the
frosting are shorter than it. You have to be able to hold the edges without
digging your fingers into the frosting when cutting out the bunnies.</p>}
