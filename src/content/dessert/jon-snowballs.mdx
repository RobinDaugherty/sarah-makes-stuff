		<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />8 ounces red candy melts
		<br />
		165 grams (5 tablespoons) unsalted butter
		<br />
		43 grams (3 tablespoons) heavy cream
		<br />
		pinch of salt
		<br />
		37 grams (1/3 cup) powdered sugar
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In a small saucepan melt butter, add heavy cream and stir to combine, then
		stir in salt, set aside.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over a double boiler melt candy melts, stirring casually until smooth and
		completely melted. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Gently stir in lukewarm butter and heavy cream mixture into melted
		chocolate. Butter and heavy cream mixture should be approximately the same
		temperature as melted candy melts before you combine them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cool slightly, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2-3 hours (or
		until firm enough to roll the balls). While it’s cooling, you can take it
		from the fridge, stir with a fork, cover again with plastic wrap and place
		back into the fridge.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a small spoon or a melon baller scoop out the mixture and roll into 1
		inch balls. You can dust your hands with powdered sugar or if it’s too
		sticky drop a spoon of mixture into powder sugar, (it makes it much easier
		to roll into a ball) then roll it again in the sugar when the ball is
		formed.
	</p>
	<p>Roll each ball into powdered sugar to coat them well.</p>
	<p>
		Store in the fridge in an airtight container up to 1 week or freeze for
		longer storage.
