{<p>Oh, Melisandre... are you a villain or not? I don't think you are. But I do
think you've done some <em>very </em>bad things thinking you were doing the
right thing. I mean, nobody is perfect but... most people haven't made the
mistake of burning an innocent child at the stake. That's a pretty big
mistake.</p>}
{<p>Maybe the Lord of Light will tell me in the flames of a batch of fire
cupcakes.</p>}
{<p>If you also want some insight from the Lord of Light, first make a batch of
red velvet cupcakes and chocolate frosting. Add in some mini chocolate chips
into the frosting to give it some texture. Frost your cupcakes, but don't
make it smooth.</p>}
{<p>Then to make the flames, the most important part, sort out the red, orange,
and yellow candies from some Life Savers 5 Flavors Hard Candy. (Really any
red, orange, and yellow hard candies would work)</p>}

tenderizer.</p>}

{<p>And put in a 350 degree oven until it completely melts and is smooth.</p>}

{<p>Once cooled and completely hardened, snap until little flame pieces.</p>}

{<p>Then stab some flames into your frosted cupcakes and stick some broken up
pretzel rods around the flames.</p>}

{<p>And there you go! Your very own fire to see your very own visions in. If you
see an onslaught of the undead let me know. Actually, don't let me know. No,
do let me know. Or not. I don't know.</p>}

	<li>
		Pipe on chocolate frosting and use a small spatula to smooth out a little
		(leave it a little rough looking).
	</li>
	<li>
		Take flame pieces and stick into top of cupcakes so it looks like a fire. 
	</li>
	<li>Break up pretzel sticks into little pieces and stick around flames.</li>
