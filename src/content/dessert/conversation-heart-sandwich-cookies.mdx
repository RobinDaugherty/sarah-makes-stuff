		Continuing the conversation heart theme this Valentine's Day, I made
		sandwich cookies! I've seen a ton of conversation heart macarons but
		figured, let's make life easy and <em>not </em>make macarons. I{' '}
		<em>still</em> haven't fully mastered those dag-gone cookies.

		Anyway! Back to the sandwich cookies! So I made a batch of sugar cookies,
		dyed three different colors. I used the teal, pink and orange from{' '}

		 but you might want to go pastel. I did the brighter/darker colors because I
		thought they would get lighter when I baked them... but they didn't...
		soooo... yeah... Don't do that. Unless you want to. You do you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then I cut them out into hearts. I used the 2-inch heart cookie cutter from
		an older version of{' '}

		. And yes, I'm totally jealous that the set is now pink.

		I then refrigerated them for half an hour to help them keep their shape,

		that was all done I piped out some cute conversation starters onto half of
		the cookies. That's what they're supposed to be, right? Conversation
		starters?

		<strong>BUTTERCREAM INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />1 1/2-2 cups powdered sugar
		<br />1 tbs vanilla extract
		<br />
		1-2 tbs milk
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar
		together until just incorporated. Lightly beat the egg and vanilla and add
		to butter-sugar mixture. Mix again on low speed, stopping to scrape down the
		sides of the bowl intermittently as needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Add to the
		butter-sugar-egg mixture.  Mix on low speed until a dough is formed and
		there are no longer any streaks of butter in the mixing bowl. The dough will
		often clump around the paddle attachment while being mixed. This is normal
		and a good sign that your dough is the right consistency.  If your mixture
		does not come together and is crumbly, add milk 1 tbs at a time until the
		dough clumps. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Divide batter three times (or however many times to get the colors you want)
		and mix in gel food coloring until the desired color is reached. I recommend
		dividing it up and then putting the separate batches back in the mixer to
		mix in the food coloring. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Roll out each batch of dough onto an <em>unfloured</em> surface. Cut out
		your heart shapes with a 2-inch heart cookie cutter and place on a cookie
		sheet lined with parchment paper. Take the leftover dough and roll it back
		out and cut out more hearts. You can continue doing this until you've run
		out of dough or you've reached your desired amount of cookies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Refrigerate your hearts for 30 minutes and then
		bake for 8-12 minutes. This is a good time to make the buttercream. Recipe
		below. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Let cool completely. Melt your{' '}

		.  Pipe on whatever sayings you want onto half of the cookies. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Pipe your buttercream onto the blank half of the cookies. Sandwich together.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>BUTTERCREAM INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment,
		beat butter until light and fluffy. Add 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and turn
		your mixer on the lowest speed (so the sugar doesn't blow everywhere) until
		the sugar has been incorporated with the butter. Increase mixer speed to
		medium and add vanilla. Beat for 3 minutes. If your frosting needs a more
		stiff consistency, add remaining sugar. If your frosting needs to be thinned
		out, add milk 1 tablespoon at a time.
