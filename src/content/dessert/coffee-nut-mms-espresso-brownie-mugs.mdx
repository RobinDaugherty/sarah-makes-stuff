		and figured I had to make something with them! First off, there's nothing
		coffee I don't love, and my mom always gave me Peanut M&amp;M's to snack on
		growing up. They're full of protein, right?! Totally healthy. I loved all
		the mini hot chocolate cookie mugs that were all over the place over the
		holidays and figured I could make some espresso brownie mugs to incorporate
		them into.

		So first I made my favorite fudgey brownies and added in some instant
		espresso powder. And by some, I mean a lot. Did I mention I love coffee? I
		rolled the batter into tablespoon size balls and patted down the little
		balls into a greased mini muffin pan. Once out of the oven, I took the back
		of my round tablespoon and pushed it into each brownie. This give it a
		little cup shape. While those were baking and cooling I got started on
		handles.

		For those I just melted down some chocolate and piped out some backward

		longer than the top so fits straight, or at least straight-ish, on your
		angled brownie bites.

		After those hardened and my brownie bites were <em>completely</em> cool, I
		attached the handles by piping two little chocolate spots onto the side of

		chocolate on there that they don't fall over. It should stay in place
		without you holding it there.

		Then I topped with some Espresso Buttercream. And for finishing touches I
		piped on some white chocolate hearts and drizzle before topping with a
		Coffee Nut M&amp;M. I would recommend putting on the hearts before the
		buttercream to make it a little easier. And when you put the drizzle on you
		want to act fast to put the M&amp;M on there before the drizzle hardens so
		it doesn't crack.

		<strong>COFFEE NUT M&amp;M'S ESPRESSO BROWNIE MUGS INGREDIENTS</strong>

		<em>makes 24 brownie mugs</em>
		<br />1 cup sugar

		<br />1 tsp vanilla extract
		<br />
		1/2 cup flour
		<br />
		1/2 cup cocoa

		<br />2 ounces white chocolate
		<br />
		Coffee Nut M&amp;M's

	<p>
		<strong>ESPRESSO BUTTERCREAM INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		<span>1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</span>
		<br />
		<span>1.5-2 cups confectioners powdered sugar, sifted</span>
		<br />
		<span>
			2 tsp vanilla extract
			<br />2 tsp instant espresso powder

		<br />

		<strong>COFFEE NUT M&amp;M'S ESPRESSO BROWNIE MUGS INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a mini muffin pan, set aside. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar together on medium speed until
		light and fluffy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In a small bowl, whip egg, vanilla, and instant espresso powder together.
		Pour into butter-sugar mixture and beat until combined. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In a medium bowl, whisk together cocoa powder and flour. Add to rest of
		mixture and mix until combined. The batter will be thick, which is exactly
		what you want for rolling your balls. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Roll tablespoon size balls of the batter and place in greased mini muffin
		pan. Pat down each ball slightly so it forms into the shape of the mold. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Bake in preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until toothpick comes out dry
		with just a few crumbs.{' '}
		<em>This is good time to make your Espresso Buttercream, recipe below. </em>
		As soon as your brownies are out of the oven, take a round tablespoon and
		push down into the middle of each brownies so it forms a little cup shape.
	</p>
	<p>
		When brownies are almost done cooling, make your handles. Melt 2 ounces of
		chocolate, per instructions on package, and place in a piping bag fitted

		. Pipe backward c-shapes onto parchment or wax paper. Tip, make sure that
		the bottom of the c-shape is slightly longer than the top so it fits
		straight onto the angled side of the brownie. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once your brownies are completely cool and your handles have hardened, pipe
		two dots of chocolate onto the side of each mug and stick a handle on. If
		you pipe enough chocolate it should stay on there without you holding it. I
		advise placing the bites back into the mini muffin pan at an angle with the
		handles sticking up to let harden. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Once your handles have hardened on, melt 2 ounces white chocolate, per
		instructions on package. Place in a piping bag fitted with a{' '}

		, pipe on your Espresso Buttercream onto the top of each brownie mug. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Pipe on your white chocolate drizzle (you may have to reheat your white
		chocolate, you can do this by removing the metal tip and placing in the
		microwave for 20-30 seconds or so) and top with a Coffee Nut M&amp;M. I
		recommend placing the Coffee Nut M&amp;M after each drizzle so your drizzle
		doesn't harden and crack when you put the M&amp;M on. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>ESPRESSO BUTTERCREAM INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment,
		beat butter until light and fluffy. Add 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and turn
		your mixer on the lowest speed (so the sugar doesn't blow everywhere) until
		the sugar has been incorporated with the butter. In a small bowl mix your
		vanilla extract and instant espresso powder together until espresso powder
		is well incorporated. Increase mixer speed to medium and add
		vanilla-espresso mixture. Beat for 3 minutes. If your frosting needs a more
		stiff consistency, add remaining sugar. If your frosting needs to be thinned
		out, add milk 1 tablespoon at a time.
