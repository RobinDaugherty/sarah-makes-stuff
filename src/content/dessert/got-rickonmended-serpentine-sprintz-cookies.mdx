	<p>Yay, Game of Thrones season seven continues tonight!</p>
	<p>
		Did anyone else rewatch any of season six recently? For some reason we
		rewatched the last two episodes. Should have stuck to just the last one.
		Rewatching Battle of Bastards was rough.

		Anyways, I got to thinking after watching that horrible scene again that I

		little reminder to zig-zag when being shot at with arrows.

		<strong>INGREDIENTS </strong>(<em>makes ~22 3-inch square serpentines)</em>
		<br />
		227 grams (1 ½ cups) unsalted butter, room temperature
		<br />
		200 grams (1 cup) granulated sugar
		<br />1 gram (¼ tsp) salt
		<br />
		108 grams (2 large) eggs, room temperature
		<br />
		13 grams (1 tbs) vanilla extract
		<br />1 gram (1 tsp) instant espresso powder
		<br />
		448 grams (3 ½ cups) all-purpose flour
		<br />
		59 grams (½ cup) unsweetened cocoa powder
		<br />
		1-3 tbs milk
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a cookie sheet with silicone mat. If you
			do not have a silicone mat, use parchment and once batter is made place a
			small amount of batter under each corner to keep it from moving around
			while piping. 
		</li>
		<li>
			In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter, sugar, and salt. Beat until
			light and fluffy.
		</li>
		<li>
			In separate bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla, and instant espresso
			powder.
		</li>
		<li>Add to butter mixture and continue to beat until incorporated.</li>
		<li>In separate bowl, sift together flour and cocoa powder.</li>
		<li>
			Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and beat until well
			incorporated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add milk one tablespoon at a time until dough clumps together and is
			smooth.
		</li>
		<li>Place in piping bag fitted with a large star piping tip.</li>
		<li>
			Pipe batter into a serpentine shape onto your lined cookie sheet. You
			should be able to fit 6 cookies on a half sheet pan. If piping is
			difficult, put batter back in mixing bowl and add more milk. The cookies
			will come out pretty much as they went in so pipe the exact shape you
			want, each turn should be touching. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Rotate baking sheet halfway through baking
			time. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Once cooled, place cookies on cooling rack and repeat steps 9 &amp; 10
			until all batter is used. 
		</li>
