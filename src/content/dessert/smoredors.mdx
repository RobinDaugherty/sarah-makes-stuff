		Mmmm... S'moredors. Lovely little cups of chocolatey, marshmallow, graham
		cracker goodness! I used regular old Milk Chocolate Promises but you go wild
		and use Caramel or Mocha Latte &amp; Dark Chocolate Swirl. Oh boy does that
		sound good now that I'm think about it. So many regrets...

		<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br />
		<span>134 grams (3/4 cup) graham cracker crumbs</span>
		<br />
		28 grams (1/4 cup) powdered sugar
		<br />
		165 grams (6 tablespoons) butter, melted
		<br />
		24  Dove Milk Chocolate Promises (or any other flavor!)
		<br />
		12 large marshmallows, cut in half
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br />
		Preheat the oven to 350°F.
	</p>
	<p>
		Combine graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar and melted butter into a small
		bowl.
	</p>
	<p>
		Evenly divide crumb mixture into each cup of a 24 cup mini muffin pan,
		grease slightly before using. Press crumbs down to form shallow cups.
	</p>
	<p>Bake 4-5 minutes or until edges are bubbling.</p>
	<p>
		While that's baking, cut the marshmallows in half using scissors that have
		been sitting in cold water.
	</p>
	<p>Remove the pan from the oven and place one chocolate into each cup.</p>
	<p>Place one marshmallow half, cut-side down, into each cup.</p>
	<p>
		Return to oven for 2-4 minutes or until marshmallows are just slightly
		softened.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you'd like the tops to be brown, turn the oven to broil, and broil the
		smores bites for 1-2 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cool on a cooling rack for 15 minutes before carefully removing them from
		the pan.
