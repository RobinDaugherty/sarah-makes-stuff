		I'm finally ready to admit defeat and post a pumpkin recipe. It's probably
		about time. We're what... 3 days away from Halloween and{' '}
		<em>less than 2 months away from Christmas</em>. Can you believe that? Where
		is the year going?

		I'm going to be honest here, I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie. I know
		that's quite controversial, but when it comes to fall pies, pecan is my jam.
		So when it comes to pumpkin, a pumpkin roll is where it's at, in my opinion.
		So, of course, when I went to make pumpkin muffins I wanted to incorporate
		some of that cream cheese delciousness that makes pumpkin rolls so heavenly.
		But just a plain old cream cheese filling is boring. It's been done a
		million times so I wanted to add a little something-something to make it
		stand out. And that little something-something was Biscoff Spread. What
		isn't better with Biscoff? Nothing. Biscoff cookies can even make me forget
		my paralyzing fear of flying, for the all of one minute it takes be devour
		those little 2-pack packages.

		These muffins have a sneaky layer of Biscoff cream cheese filling. They
		aren't in your face Biscoff, but I think the flavor really adds something
		nice to the regular pumpkin spice flavor. And mixing it with the cream
		cheese makes the muffins moister and more delicious.
