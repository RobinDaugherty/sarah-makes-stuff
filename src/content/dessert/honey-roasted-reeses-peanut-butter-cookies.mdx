		I stumbled upon{' '}
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hersheyflavorsofamerica.com">
			Honey Roasted Reese’s
		</a>
		 and figured I had to bake something with them seeing how they said they
		were the “flavor of Georgia” and I’m a Georgia girl. Well, at least I was
		born there. Hey, I still have family there so it has to count for something.

		Apparently Hershey's made some{' '}
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hersheyflavorsofamerica.com">
			limited edition flavors of their candy bars
		</a>{' '}
		matching them with states. Like Strawberry Kit Kats for California and, of
		course, Cherry Cheesecake Hershey Bars for New York. Both of those were
		delicious by they way, if Reese’s isn’t your cup of tea, or even if it is,
		the more chocolate the better, right?!

		These cookies are thin, but so soft and delicious. It’s hard not eat all of
		them in one sitting! Somehow over the weekend mine all disappeared! I want
		to blame my husband, but I have to be honest with myself, it was me. I’m
		pretty sure I ate at least 75% of the batch. I’m not proud, but I have no
		regrets.

		You’re going to have to hurry if you want to make these though! The Honey
		Roasted flavor is limited edition and I’ve already noticed that Strawberry
		Kit Kats and the Cherry Cheesecake Hershey Bar is out at my local
		convenience store! I’m sure regular ol’ Reese’s cups would be just as
		delicious if you can't find the Honey Roasted flavor though.

		<br />
		1/2 cup light brown sugar

		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
	</p>
	<ol dir="ltr">
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment or
			silicone mats.
		</li>
		<li>
			In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set
			aside.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat
			butter until light and fluffy. Add sugars and continuing mixing on medium
			speed until it's again light fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides.
			Add peanut butter, beating until incorporated. Add the egg and continue to
			beat until well combined.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients in two batches, mixing on
			low and making sure to mix just until combined. Over mixing can cause your
			cookies to become tough. Turn the mixer off and stir in your chopped
			Reese’s cups.
		</li>
		<li>
			Using a cookie scoop (or eye-balling it) roll dough into 1-inch balls and
			place on prepared pans, about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes or
			until the cookies are set on the edges but still soft in the center. Let
			cool for 5 minutes before transferring, the cookies are very soft when
			warm and tend to break. 
		</li>
