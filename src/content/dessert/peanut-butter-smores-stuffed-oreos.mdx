{<p>These are the best of both worlds, peanut butter s'mores flavor, without
having to go outside or deal with sticky marshmallow hands! Anyone else not
understand why it makes sense to have an extremely sticky treat while you're
camping and have limited resources to clean your hands? Maybe that's just me.
I don't really <em>do</em> camping so I probably can't have an opinion on the
matter. Confession, my s'mores have always been made in the microwave. I don't
think I've ever had a real campfire s'mores. #notaboutthatbuglife</p>}

{<p>But I am a huge fan of switching out the chocolate bar with something with
peanut butter though (it works pretty well in the microwave at least). I mean,
in my opinion, you can't really go wrong adding peanut butter to anything. I
could never be paleo, along with the obvious sugar addiction I have, I gotta
have my peanut butter. Almond butter does <em>not</em> have anything on peanut
butter and anyone who says otherwise obviously hasn't had peanut butter in a
long time. A <em>very</em> long time.</p>}

{<p>So yes, these are super simple to make and perfect for the last of your summer
parties. Your guests will thank you with their clean, non-sticky hands.</p>}
{<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
<br />
67 grams (¼ cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
<br />
64 grams (¼ cup) creamy peanut butter
<br />
192 grams (1 ½ cups) powdered sugar
<br />5 grams (1 tsp) vanilla extract
<br />
1-3 tbs milk
<br />
30 grams (⅔ cup) mini marshmallows
<br />4 graham cracker sheets (60 grams)
<br />
80 grams (½ cup) Reese's Minis
<br />
16 ounces chocolate (for melting)
<br />1 graham cracker sheet  (15 grams)</p>}
{<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>}

<ol>
	<li>
		In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together butter and
		peanut butter until well combined.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add in powdered sugar and continue beating until incorporated. It will be
		thick.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add in vanilla and 1 tablespoon milk. Mix, if still too thick, add in more
		milk, little by little. If you make it too thin, you can always add more
		powdered sugar. You want it to be a like a thick cookie dough consistency.
	</li>
	<li>

		or meat tenderizer, crush into crumbs.

		bowl.

	<li>
		Spead mini marshmallows into an even layer on a baking sheet lined with
		parchment paper.
	</li>
	<li>
		Place in oven and broil on high until marshmallows are golden brown. This
		does not take long, so keep an eye on them. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Once golden, immediately remove from oven and scrape into bowl with cream
		filling.
	</li>
	<li>Quickly stir together until well incorporated. </li>
	<li>
		Roll out graham cracker-peanut butter mixture into teaspoon size balls and
		place on half of the unfilled Oreo cookies. 
	</li>
	<li>

		place on second half of the unfilled Oreo cookies. 
	</li>
	<li>

		halves.
