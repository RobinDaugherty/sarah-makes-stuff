{<p>Castle Black is going to be in a jam soon. And man has it been a long time
coming. By the way, Castle Black is the castle at The Wall, you know, where
the Night's Watch is. Where the White Walkers are about to be. Yeah, that's
a going to quite a jam.</p>}

{<p>Castle Black being in a jam is a bad thing, filled with a lot of undead
people, and soon to be undead people, but these cookies having jam, is a good
thing. A deliciously good thing. No undead are involved in making of these jam
filled cookies.</p>}

{<p>Oh, and these snowball cookies are wonderful all on their own but with the
blackberry jam - muy, muy bueno! And even if you don't make these cookies, get
some blackberry jam. Actually, I have a slight confession, I used blackberry
preserves. (They came in a prettier jar! I'm such a sucker for good
packaging!) Blackberry jam (or preserves) on toast is heavenly.</p>}

{<p>Not to go too much on a tangent here, but do you know what the difference is
between jam and preserves? How about jam, jelly, and preserves? If you don't,
you are not alone. I didn't either. All of them are made of fruit, sugar, and
pectin but jelly is made with fruit juice, preserves are made with chunks of
fruit in a syrup, and jam is made with fruit pulp or crushed fruit. Now you
know!</p>}

{<p>So whether you need a treat while watching for the aforementioned jam, which I
just know they're going to drag out until at least the end of this season, or
you have no clue what I'm talking about and wish I would just knock it off
with these ridiculous punny desserts, I hope you make these cookies and enjoy.
Or at least pick up some blackberry preserves.</p>}
{<p><strong>INGREDIENTS </strong>
<em>makes about 2 dozen cookies</em>
<br />
227 grams (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature
<br />
240 grams (2 cups) powdered sugar, divided
<br />
15 grams (1 tbs) vanilla extract
<br />
15 grams (1 tbs) water
<br />
255 grams (2 cups) all-purpose flour
<br />
1.5 grams (¼ tsp) salt
<br />
82 grams (¾ cup) pecans, finely chopped
<br />
320 grams (½ cup) blackberry jam</p>}
{<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>}

<ol>
	<li>
		Preheat oven to 325℉. Line a baking sheet with silicone mat or parchment
		paper.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the bowl of an electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat together
		butter with 60 grams (1/2 cup) of the powdered sugar until light and fluffy.
		Add vanilla and continue to beat until incorporated.
	</li>
	<li>
		In a separate bowl, drizzle water over flour and stir together. Then add
		salt and continue to stir until incorporated. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients in 3 batches, mixing on low speed,
		until just combined. Add pecans and mix until combined.
	</li>
	<li>
		Roll out cookie dough into 1-inch size balls. Using your thumb, gently press
		a shallow hole into half of the balls of cookie dough, making sure not press
		all the way through.
	</li>
	<li>Fill each hole with a scant ¼ tsp of blackberry jam. </li>
	<li>
		With the rest of the balls of cookie dough, gently flatten into a disk and
		place on top of your jam filled cookie dough halves. Making sure to cover
		all of the jam. Gently seal edges together and roll into a ball. Place on a
		cookie sheet and place in refrigerator for half an hour.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bake in two batches, taking half of the cookie dough balls and placing on
		prepared cookie sheet, at least 2 inches apart. 
	</li>
	<li>Bake for 13-15 minutes, or until set but not browned. </li>
	<li>Meanwhile, place remaining powdered sugar into a bowl.</li>
	<li>
		When cookies are done baking, let cool on sheet until cool enough to touch,
		but still warm.
	</li>
	<li>
		While still warm, gently roll each cookie in powdered sugar and place on
		cooling rack. Once completely cool, gently roll again in powdered sugar.
		Store in airtight container. 
	</li>
